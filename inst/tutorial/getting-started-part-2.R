    "Try typing in the text box. The children of the output component updates",
    "right away. Let's break down what's happening here:",
    "               1. The inputs and outputs of our application interface are described",
    "declaratively through the `app$callback` method.",
    "2. In DashR, the inputs and outputs are the",
    "properties of a particular component. In this example,",
    "our input is the `value` property of the component that has the ID",
    "`'my-id'`. Our output is the `children` property of the",
    "component with the ID `'my-div'`.",
    "3. Whenever an input property changes, the function that the",
    "callback decorator wraps will get called automatically.",
    "Dash provides the function with the new value of the input property as",
    "an input argument and Dash updates the property of the output component",
    "with whatever was returned by the function.",
    "4. The `component_id` and `component_property` keywords are optional",
    "(there are only two arguments for each of those objects).",
    "I have included them here for clarity but I will omit them from here on",
    "out for brevity and readability.",
    "5. Don't confuse the `dash.dependencies.Input` object from the",
    "`dash_core_components.Input` object. The former is just used in these",
    "callbacks and the latter is an actual component.",
    "6. Notice how we don't set a value for the `children` property of the",
    "`my-div` component in the `layout`. When the Dash app starts, it",
    "automatically calls all of the callbacks with the initial values of the",
    "input components in order to populate the initial state of the output",
    "components. In this example, if you specified something like",
    "`htmlDiv(id='my-div', children='Hello world')`, it would get overwritten",
    "when the app starts.",
    "",
    "It's sort of like programming with Microsoft Excel:",
    "whenever an input cell changes, all of the cells that depend on that cell",
    "will get updated automatically. This is called 'Reactive Programming'.",

    "Remember how every component was described entirely through its set of",
    "keyword arguments? Those properties are important now.",
    "With Dash interactivity, we can dynamically update any of those properties",
    "through a callback function. Frequently we'll update the `children` of a",
    "component to display new text or the `figure` of a `coreGraph` component",
    "to display new data, but we could also update the `style` of a component or",
    "even the available `options` of a `coreDropdown` component!",

    "1. We're using the [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) library for importing",

    "2. We load our dataframe at the start of the app: `df = pd.read_csv('...')`.",
    "This dataframe `df` is in the global state of the app and can be",
    "read inside the callback functions.",
    "3. Loading data into memory can be expensive. By loading querying data at",
    "the start of the app instead of inside the callback functions, we ensure",
    "that this operation is only done when the app server starts. When a user",
    "visits the app or interacts with the app, that data (the `df`)",
    "is already in memory.",
    "If possible, expensive initialization (like downloading or querying data)",
    "should be done in the global scope of the app instead of within the",
    "callback functions.",
    "4. The callback does not modify the original data, it just creates copies",
    "of the dataframe by filtered through pandas filters.",
    "This is important: *your callbacks should never mutate variables",
    "outside of their scope*. If your callbacks modify global state, then one",
    "user's session might affect the next user's session and when the app is",
    "deployed on multiple processes or threads, those modifications will not",
