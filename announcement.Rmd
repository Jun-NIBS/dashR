I'm super excited to announce a new R package, [dasher](https://github.com/plotly/dasher), which is essentially the R version of [dash](https://plot.ly/dash/). With dasher, you can build reactive web applications entirely in R using a framework very similar to dash. in a syntax that looks and feels very similar to dash. 

## Hello world example

```r

```

## But I already know shiny...why use dasher?

### Powered by react & dash-renderer

* Efficient updates thanks to react and react-dom
  * Do a benchmark?
* Easy to create/leverage custom components
  * Do an example of creating R package from https://github.com/plotly/dash-table-experiments

### Web server exposed as first-class citizen
