I'm super excited to announce a new R package, [dasher](https://github.com/plotly/dasher), which is essentially  [dash](https://plot.ly/dash/) for R. With dasher, you can build reactive web applications entirely in R using an API that looks nearly identical to the dash (python) version. That means, if you already know dash, and want/need to leverage R (rather python) functionality, it's straight-forward to translate your existing knowledge/applications from dash to dasher (or vice versa). Dasher also offers some functionality that is unique to R, such as automatic rendering of [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/).

## Hello world example

```r

```

## But I already know shiny...why use dasher?

### Powered by react & dash-renderer

* Efficient updates thanks to react and react-dom
  * Do a benchmark?
* Easy to create/leverage custom components
  * Do an example of creating R package from https://github.com/plotly/dash-table-experiments
  
### Dash components -- write once, use everywhere


### Dash HTML components

### Dash core components

Talk about how this sort of thing is difficult in shiny <https://plot.ly/dash/urls> (versus shinyjs hacks, also <http://jaehyeon-kim.github.io/2016/06/Some-Thoughts-On-Shiny-Open-Source-Render-Multiple-Pages.html>)

### No global distinction between inputs and outputs

Shiny makes a 'global' distinction between inputs and outputs. There are certain things you can do with input elements that you can't necessarily do with outputs (and vice versa). For example, you can't really (in a generalized sense) obtain a value/property from a shiny output and use it as an input value to another output. This is not the case in dash. It's true that, for a given callback, you need to define what layout elements are input(s) vs output, but the output for one callback might be the input for another callback. 

### More transparent

Market to developers here. For example, shiny adds/removes special class to DOM elements to achieve some of it's magic, making it difficult to customize styling and so forth...
