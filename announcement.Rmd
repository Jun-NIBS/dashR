I'm super excited to announce a new R package, [dasher](https://github.com/plotly/dasher), which is essentially  [dash](https://plot.ly/dash/) for R. With dasher, you can build reactive web applications entirely in R using an API that looks nearly identical to the dash (python) version. That means, if you already know dash, and want/need to leverage R (rather python) functionality, it's straight-forward to translate your existing knowledge/applications from dash to dasher (or vice versa). Dasher also offers some functionality that is unique to R, such as automatic rendering of [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/).

## Hello world example

```r

```

## But I already know shiny...why use dasher?

### Powered by react & dash-renderer

* Efficient updates thanks to react and react-dom
  * Do a benchmark?
* Easy to create/leverage custom components
  * Do an example of creating R package from https://github.com/plotly/dash-table-experiments
  
### Dash components -- write once, use everywhere



### Web server exposed as first-class citizen
